##The final task involved designing a smart home mobile app interface with voice-command capabilities. I created a user-friendly dashboard with controls for lights, thermostat, and other smart devices. A floating microphone icon allowed users to activate voice commands. Feedback UI, such as “Lights turned off” and “Thermostat set to 22°C,” was included as part of the interaction flow. I used prototyping tools to map the user journey through voice interactions, aiming for a seamless and intuitive experience. This task deepened my knowledge of voice UX, accessibility, and command-based navigation.
